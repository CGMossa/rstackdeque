Title: Persistent, fast amortized stack and deque (double-ended queue) data
    structures for R.

Description: Provides stack and deque data structures for R: rstack() and
    rdeque(). For efficiency, these structures support limited access; for
    stacks: insert_top(), peek_top(), and without_top() (the latter returning a
    version of the stack without the top element); for deques: insert_front(),
    peek_front(), and without_front() (the latter returning a version of the
    deque without the front element), as well as corresponding methods
    insert_back(), peek_back(), and without_back(). Both types also support
    O(N) conversion to lists with, as.list(), and for convenience
    as.data.frame(), which requires that all element have the same length() and
    non-contradictory names().

Title: Persistent, fast amortized stack and deque (double-ended queue) data
    structures for R.

Description: Provides stack, deque and queue data structures for R: rstack(),
    rdeque() and rpqueue(). For efficiency, these structures support limited
    access; for stacks: insert_top(), peek_top(), and without_top() (the latter
    returning a version of the stack without the top element); for queues:
    insert_front(), peek_front(), and without_front() (the latter returning a
    version of the deque without the front element), and for dequeues
    additional corresponding methods insert_back(), peek_back(), and
    without_back(). All types also support O(N) conversion to lists with
    as.list(), and to data frames with as.data.frame(), which requires that all
    element have the same length and non-contradictory names.
